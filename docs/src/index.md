# IntegralTransforms.jl

This is the initial commit to the Documentation of IntegralTransforms.jl

We will start by trying to introduce production-oriented pragmatic coders towards the skillset that lets one use Julia to its full capacity through the Laplace Transform Example,  ℒ, and its inverse, invℒ.

Documentation for IntegralTransforms.jl

```@docs
ℒ(x)
```

The first link can be plaintext, the second can be a function, etc.

## Other Transforms

Other transforms of interest will be added eventually. Any contributing PRs to those signalled in the README are more than welcome.

## Tutorials

TODO: Follow the step-by-step guide on build-a-Transf to see how you can do some macro magic and contribute.

## Basic Toolchain
You should probably understand the stages of compilation of Julia, what are "generated" functions, and have done some basic tutorials on macro escaping and hygiene.
