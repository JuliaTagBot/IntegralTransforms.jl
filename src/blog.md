A first attempt was made at a package.
I still have some difficulty trying to overload the ForwardDiff utilities.
I am trying to shadow a tutorial on AD for the most basic functionality but do not know if I should switch to a macro/generated function based approach that can pattern-match more appropriately.
My next step should be just trying to get stuff from [this appendix B](https://www.svce.ac.in/departments/maths/Lapref.pdf) onto basic functionality.
